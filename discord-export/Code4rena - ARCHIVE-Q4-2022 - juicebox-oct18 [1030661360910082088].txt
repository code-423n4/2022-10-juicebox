but


[10/19/2022 18:44] ladboy233
```solidity
  // Make the original un-initializable.
    require(address(this) != codeOrigin);
    // Stop re-initialization.
    require(address(store) == address(0));
```


[10/19/2022 18:44] ladboy233
guard against it.

@jango Mind if I ask you a question privately?


[10/19/2022 20:45] jango420
sure


[10/20/2022 02:31] jango420
Gn!


[10/20/2022 03:05] ladboy233
@member reservedRate The number of minted tokens needed in the tier to allow for minting another reserved token.


[10/20/2022 03:05] ladboy233
what does this mean?


[10/20/2022 11:51] jango420
With a reservedRate of 10, one NFT can be minted in the tier to a special beneficiary address for each 10 minted organically.


[10/20/2022 11:51] jango420
I.e Nouns has a reserved rate of 9 since each 10th noun is reserved.


[10/20/2022 11:54] ladboy233
Oh that is what it means.


[10/20/2022 11:55] ladboy233
I thought it means 10 NFT reserved for the team.


[10/20/2022 11:55] ladboy233

[10/23/2022 20:11] horsefacts
I didn't have as much time as I hoped for this one, but wanted to pass on one little thing. There are a few places in the tests where you're converting strings to test addresses, like:

```
address _user = address(bytes20(keccak256('user')));
```

There's a helper that was recently added to  `forge-std/Test` that does exactly this, plus tags the address so that it will show up labeled in traces:

```
address _user = makeAddr('user');
```

gg everyone, I'm looking forward to this feature!

I gave a first pass on findings, thank you all, valid or not, all issue opened makes us think twice about some of the logic (extra kudos for the Forge PoC that I'll pasta now as additional safety guard:)
