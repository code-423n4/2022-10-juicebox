# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Provide contest details

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Add all of the code to this repo that you want reviewed

# Contest prep

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the contest ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the contest. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## Motivation

If added to an existing project via a funding cycle, NFT rewards can provide additional incentive for contributors to participate in funding of a project.

## Mechanic

Within one collection, NFTs can be minted within any number of pre-programmed tiers.

Each tier has the following optional properties:

- a contribution floor amount.
- a max quantity.
- a number of voting units to associate with each unit within the tier.
- a reserved rate, allowing a proprtion of units within the tier to be minted to a pre-programmed beneficiary.
- URI, overridable by a URI resolver that can return dynamic values for each unit with the tier.
- a lock date, before which the tier must remain accessible.

New tiers can be added, so long as they respect the contract's `flags` that specify if new tiers can influence voting units, reserved quantities, or be manually minted.

Tiers can also be removed, so long as they are not locked.

An incoming payment can specify any number of tiers to mint as part of the payment, so long as the tier's prices are contained within the paid amount. If specific tiers aren't specified, the best available tier will be minted, unless a flag is specifically sent along with the payment telling the contract to not mint.

If a payment received does not meet a minting threshold or is in excess of the minted tiers, the balance is stored as a credit which will be added to future payments and applied to mints at that time. A flag can also be passed to avoid accepting payments that aren't applied to mints in full. 

The contract's owner can mint on demand from tier's that have been pre-programmed to allow manual token minting.

The NFTs from each tier can also be used for redemptions against the underlying Juicebox treasury. The rate of redemptions corresponds to the price floor of the tier being redeemed, compared to the total price floors of all minted NFTs.

The collection can be used for on-chain governance. Votes can be solicited from all tiers, or only from specific tiers.
